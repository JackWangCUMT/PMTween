* Updated Podspec

1.2.0
=====
* Implemented additive animation in PMTweenUnit!
* Updated PMTweenObjectUpdater to provide additive updating support.
* Updated tests.
* Updated Examples project to include additive demos.

1.1.2
=====
* Fixed multiple tweens targeting same object property incorrectly overriding initial value of first tween.

1.1.1
=====
* Fixed PMTweenUnit and PMTweenPhysicsUnit failing to tween object properties specified by a single-element keyPath.
* Fixed NSNumber object properties with a nil value not tweening. Such properties are now initialized with the specified starting value during the init method.
* Changed all init methods to return instancetype instead of id.
* More tests.

1.1.0
=====
* Added PMTweenPhysicsUnit and PMTweenPhysicsSystem classes to provide dynamic, physics-based tweening! PMTweenPhysicsUnit adopts PMTweening, so you get all the standard PMTween functionality â€“ use it in groups and sequences, add reversing, pause it, etc. See the documentation and examples project for more info.
* Fixed bug where PMTweening classes set to reversing wouldn't reverse properly inside a PMTweenGroup that wasn't itself reversing.
currentValue property wasn't being set to startingValue in PMTweenUnit on setup.
* New tests.
* Updated examples project.

1.0.1
=====
* PMTweenBeat: Fixed this class not having a default tempo or setting child tween tempos to nil.
* PMTweenGroup: Base init method was not calling setTempo.

1.0.0
=====
* First release
